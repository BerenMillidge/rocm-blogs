# ROCm blogs

Welcome to the ROCm blog repository.

ROCm blogs range from general topic overviews to more technical walkthroughs where we share best
practices and lessons learned during our testing of software applications, libraries, and frameworks on
AMD GPUs.

We currently showcase the following topics:

* Implementations of mathematical algorithms, such as partial differential equation discretizations,
  linear algebra, and solvers
* Optimizations for artificial intelligence and high performance computing applications
  and machine learning models
* Tips and tricks to leverage ROCm tools, the ROCm software stack, and hardware-level optimizations
* Ecosystem and partner relations

Several of the technical blogs contain accompanying code samples, which we encourage you to
experiment with. Our intention is to provide content that targets domain experts and
computational/data scientists alike. While our optimization strategies may be specific to a particular
application/model, we believe that the content can serve as a guideline and an effective starting point to help
you get the best experience out of your AMD GPUs.
