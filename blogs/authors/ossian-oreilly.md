# Ossian O'Reilly

Ossian O'Reilly is a Member of Technical Staff (MTS) Software System Design Engineer
in the Data Center GPU Solutions and Performance Analysis group at AMD. He works on
porting and optimizing scientific computing and engineering applications for AMD GPUs.
He holds a PhD in Geophysics from Stanford University and in Computational Mathematics
from Link√∂ping University, Sweden. His PhD research focused on high order numerica
l methods for seismic wave propagation containing frictional interfaces and fluid-filled
cracks with applications to earthquake and volcano seismology, and the oil and gas
industry. As a postdoc, he worked on numerical method development and analysis for
seismic wave propagation with topography and implementing GPU stencil kernels targeting
the OLCF Summit supercomputer. Some of Ossian's technical interests include high order
numerical methods for partial differential equations, stencil-based and matrix-free
methods, as well as GPU kernel development and optimization.
