# Ossian O'Reilly

Ossian is a Member of Technical Staff (MTS), Software System Design Engineer in the Data Center GPU
Solutions and Performance Analysis group at AMD. He works on porting and optimizing scientific
computing and engineering applications for AMD GPUs.

Ossian holds a PhD in Geophysics from Stanford University and a PhD in Computational Mathematics
from Link√∂ping University, Sweden. His doctoral research focused on high-order numerical methods
for seismic wave propagation containing frictional interfaces and fluid-filled cracks, with applications to
earthquake and volcano seismology, and the Oil & Gas industry. As a postdoc, he worked on
numerical method development and analysis for seismic wave propagation with topography and
implementing GPU stencil kernels targeting the OLCF Summit supercomputer. Some of Ossian's
technical interests include high-order numerical methods for partial differential equations,
stencil-based and matrix-free methods, and GPU kernel development and optimization.
