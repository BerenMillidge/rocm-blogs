Thomas is a Member of Technical Staff (MTS), Software System Design Engineer in the Data Center GPU
Solutions and Performance Analysis group. He obtained his PhD in computational mathematics from
Imperial College London, where he specialized in mixed finite element discretizations for numerical
weather modeling codes. After completing his PhD in 2020, Thomas continued to work on
structure-preserving ("compatible") finite element methods and multigrid preconditioners for weather
applications. He began shifting his research towards accelerating fluid dynamics codes using GPUs and
developed high-fidelity/low-dissipation discontinuous Galerkin methods for turbulence and
combustion models on GPUs. His current research interests include optimizing C, C++, and Fortran
GPU applications; iterative solvers and preconditioning; finite element discretizations; and numerical
weather prediction applications.
