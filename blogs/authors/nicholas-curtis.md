# Nicholas Curtis

Nicholas is a Senior Member of Technical Staff (SMTS) in the Data Center GPU Solutions and
Performance Analysis group at AMD. Nick has led AMD's efforts working on porting and optimizing
Kokkos' HIP backend, and was responsible for LAMMPS porting and optimization for the Frontier
Center of Excellence. Nick obtained his PhD in Energy and Thermal Sciences at the University of
Connecticut, where he studied GPU-accelerated reacting flow simulation. Nick's research interests
include high-level languages and their implementation on GPUs, compiler and runtime analysis
and optimization, low-level GPU microbenchmarking and profiling, and the interaction of GPU
hardware and runtimes with the Linux kernel.
