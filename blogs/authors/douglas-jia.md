# Douglas Jia

Douglas is a Principal Deep Learning Data Scientist at AMD, where he specializes in assisting enterprise
customers with the optimization and deployment of large language models (LLMs) and other deep
learning models on AMD GPUs. Before joining AMD, Douglas gained extensive experience during his
tenure at Google and JPMorgan Chase, where he dedicated several years to the development of
natural language models, fine-tuning LLMs, and conducting online controlled experiments
(A/B testing). He holds a PhD in Biostatistics with expertise spanning causal inference, product analytics
and strategic analysis.
