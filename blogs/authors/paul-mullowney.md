Paul is a Principal Member of Technical Staff (PMTS) in the Data Center GPU Solutions and Performance
Analysis group at AMD. He received his PhD in Applied Mathematics from the University of Colorado at
Boulder in 2004. Early in his career, Paul focused on porting and optimizing a variety of different
software applications to run on GPU clusters. This included code for electromagnetic Particle-in-Cell,
sparse linear algebra, and radiation transport in climate codes. Following this work, he spent 7 years in
AI/ML working on both large-scale (satellite imagery) and small-scale (mobile embedded biometrics)
applications. In these roles, his focus was on HPC deployment of trained AI/ML models. Since joining
AMD, he has worked on porting several CFD applications to the Frontier Exascale system. In his spare
time, he enjoys playing soccer, skiing, and mountain biking.
