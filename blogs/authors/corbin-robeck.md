# Corbin Robeck

Corbin Robeck is a Member of Technical Staff in AMD Research working on GPU kernel performance
optimization tools for HPC frameworks and machine learning compilers. Prior to AMD, Corbin
was a member of the US Department of Defense HPC CREATE program and the computational engineering
division at Argonne National Lab focused on large scale fluid structure interaction simulations.
Corbinâ€™s technical interests currently lie in programming model and architecture abstraction layers,
metaprogramming on heterogeneous HPC systems, HPC/ML framework centric features in the AMDGCN
compiler backend, and compiler and runtime-based analysis and optimization tools for GPU-based
HPC and machine learning frameworks.
