Yao is a Member of Technical Staff (MTS) in the Research and Advanced Development group at AMD.
Her focus involves AI for science and manufacturing, and large language models. In AI for science, she
works internally and externally with academia to enhance traditional HPC applications with machine
learning to accelerate scientific discoveries. In AI for manufacturing, she works internally with product
teams to use machine learning (ML) to uncover optimal parameters and configurations in AMD
designs.
Prior to joining AMD, Yao worked as a Data Scientist at KUKA Robotics, where she led predictive
maintenance projects for industrial KUKA robots and worked on deep learning projects, such as
teaching robots to pick up objects. She holds a PhD in Computational Chemistry from Rice University.
