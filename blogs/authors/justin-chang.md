# Justin Chang

Justin Chang is a Senior Member of Technical Staff (SMTS) Software System Design
Engineer in the Data Center GPU HPC Solutions and Performance Analysis Group. He
received his PhD degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Houston, where
he published several journal papers on structure-preserving high performance
computational methods for transport in porous media. As a postdoc, he worked for
both Rice University and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to accelerate
finite element simulation time of subsurface flow through dual porosity porous
medium and lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles. He also worked for
the Oil and Gas industry and focused on GPU porting and optimization of key
FWI, RTM, and other seismic imaging workloads.
