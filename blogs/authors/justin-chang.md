Justin is a Senior Member of Technical Staff (SMTS), Software System Design Engineer in the Data
Center GPU HPC Solutions and Performance Analysis Group. He received his PhD degree in Civil
Engineering from the University of Houston, where he published several journal papers on
structure-preserving, high-performance computational methods for transport in porous media. As a
postdoc, he worked for both Rice University and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to
accelerate finite element simulation time of subsurface flow through dual porosity porous media and
lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles. He also worked for the Oil & Gas industry where he
focused on GPU porting and the optimization of key seismic imaging workloads (such as FWI and
RTM).
