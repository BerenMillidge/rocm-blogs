Noel is a Senior Member of Technical Staff (SMTS) in the Data Center GPU Solutions and Performance
Analysis group at AMD. Noel is the lead developer of the rocHPL benchmark, AMD's optimized
implementation of the well-known LINPACK benchmark, which is responsible for achieving over 1
Exaflop of performance on the Frontier supercomputer at ORNL. Noel obtained a PhD in Applied
Mathematics from the University of Waterloo, where he studied convergence and stability properties of
the discontinuous Galerkin finite element method on hyperbolic systems. Noel's research interests
include the GPU acceleration of high-order continuous and discontinuous finite element methods, and
large-scale geometric and algebraic multigrid methods.
